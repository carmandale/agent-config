The CC3 skills have frontmatter issues that cause warnings on Pi-agent startup.\n\n## Issues to Fix\n\n### Critical (breaks loading)\n1. **Name collisions** (4 skills) - archive/ folder has duplicates:\n   - async-repl-protocol\n   - router-first-architecture  \n   - search-hierarchy\n   - search-tools\n   \n2. **Names with underscores** (8 skills) - must be lowercase a-z, 0-9, hyphens only:\n   - continuity_ledger → continuity-ledger\n   - create_handoff → create-handoff\n   - describe_pr → describe-pr\n   - implement_plan → implement-plan\n   - implement_plan_micro → implement-plan-micro\n   - implement_task → implement-task\n   - resume_handoff → resume-handoff\n   - system_overview → system-overview\n\n3. **Missing descriptions** (8 skills):\n   - loogle-search, recall, remember, system_overview\n   - tldr-deep, tldr-overview, tldr-router, tour\n\n4. **Name mismatches** (4 skills) - frontmatter name ≠ directory name:\n   - math-unified has name: math\n   - agent-browser has name: Agent Browser\n   - self-improving-agent has name: self-improvement\n   - superdesign has name: frontend-design\n\n### Warnings (noisy but non-blocking)\n- ~60 skills have unknown frontmatter fields: user-invocable, triggers, priority, keywords, model, version, type, homepage, read_when\n\n## Proposed Fix Order\n1. Remove archive/ folder (fixes collisions immediately)\n2. Rename underscore directories to hyphens\n3. Add missing descriptions\n4. Fix name mismatches in frontmatter\n5. (Optional) Remove unknown frontmatter fields or update Pi-agent to ignore them","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"dale.carman@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-20T15:35:46.269729-06:00","created_by":"Dale Carman","updated_at":"2026-01-20T15:35:46.269729-06:00"}
