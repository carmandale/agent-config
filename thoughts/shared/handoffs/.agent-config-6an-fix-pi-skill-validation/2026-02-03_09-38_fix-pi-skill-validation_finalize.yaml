goal: "Fix pi skill validation errors reported for compound-docs, create-agent-skills, and last30days skills"
now: "All skill validation errors resolved. Fixed invalid frontmatter fields in 3 skills: removed preconditions from compound-docs, fixed name mismatch in create-agent-skills, removed invalid fields from last30days"

done_this_session:
  - "Fixed compound-docs: Removed invalid 'preconditions:' frontmatter field"
  - "Fixed create-agent-skills: Changed name from 'creating-agent-skills' to 'create-agent-skills' to match directory"
  - "Fixed last30days: Removed invalid fields (argument-hint, context, agent, disable-model-invocation)"
  - "Moved last30days argument hint into description field"
  - "Fixed last30days allowed-tools format from comma-separated to YAML list"
  - "Created and closed bead .agent-config-6an to track the work"

decisions:
  - "Skills symlink to actual sources in Dropbox - edits to symlinks modify the source files"
  - "Valid pi skill frontmatter fields: name, description, allowed-tools, model only"

findings:
  - "compound-docs, create-agent-skills symlink through ~/.pi/agent/skills/compound/ to Dropbox compound-engineering-plugin"
  - "last30days symlinks through ~/.pi/agent/skills/tools/ to Dropbox last30days-skill"
  - "Pi skill validator is stricter than Claude Code skill spec - rejects unknown frontmatter fields"
