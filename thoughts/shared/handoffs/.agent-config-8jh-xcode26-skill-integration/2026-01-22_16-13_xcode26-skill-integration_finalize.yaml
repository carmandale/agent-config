goal: "Integrate Xcode26-Agent-Skills repo into unified agent-config so the xcode-26 skill is available to all agents (Pi, Claude Code, Codex)"
now: "Symlinks created, skill verified working in both Pi and Codex agents"

done_this_session:
  - "Investigated Xcode26-Agent-Skills repo structure and installation options"
  - "Discovered skill is Apple's hidden Xcode AI documentation (from IDEIntelligenceChat.framework) with corrections"
  - "Created symlink: ~/.agent-config/skills/swift/xcode-26 → repo's xcode-26/ folder"
  - "Created top-level alias: ~/.agent-config/skills/xcode-26 → swift/xcode-26"
  - "Verified skill availability in Pi agent - successfully read and listed all 20 topics"
  - "Verified skill availability in Codex agent - successfully read and listed all 17 topics"

decisions:
  - "Used symlink approach (Option A) instead of openskills or copying"
  - "Placed skill in swift/ category alongside existing Swift-related skills"
  - "Used curated version with corrections rather than raw Xcode files"

findings:
  - "Apple bundles AI documentation in Xcode at: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/PlugIns/IDEIntelligenceChat.framework/Versions/A/Resources/AdditionalDocumentation/"
  - "Skill pack has 5 corrected files adding iOS 26 version references and fixing Foundation Models temperature"
  - "20 reference files covering: Liquid Glass (4 platforms), Foundation Models, Swift Concurrency, StoreKit, App Intents, AlarmKit, Visual Intelligence, MapKit, Swift Charts 3D, SwiftData, and more"
